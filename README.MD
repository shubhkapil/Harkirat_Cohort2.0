This repository contains all files related to the Harkirat_2.0 cohort. The main objective of this cohort is to strengthen students' web development foundations and build real-world skills on top of them.

My motivation for joining this cohort lies in entering the realms of web development and upgrading my skills in the same. I have been following Harkirat for a long time through his YouTube channel and believe that he is one of the best mentors for this domain.

I will be uploading all my updates in the form of codes/assignments and mini-projects.

Stay tuned with me through this incredible journey.
